Designed and built a responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JS to bring to life my favorite movie characters! My process is documented here to show how I designed these sites and how I used user feedback to improve. I was able to choose my own topic, but I had to make the page responsive and include multiple JavaScript features along with enhancing the user experience so that the page was enjoyable and intuitive for the users.
